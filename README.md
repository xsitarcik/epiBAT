# the epiBAT algorithm
This is an implementation of the epiBAT algorithm for SNP epistasis detection. The epiBAT algorithm is based on the bat algorithm and the tabu search. It uses two objective functions: K2-score and Gini score. Objectives are not combined, but are separately used in two populations. The best bats of both populations are then combined together to obtain the candidate set, which is evaluated for significance with modified G-test. The epiBAT algorithm is implemented in Python3 with numpy, pandas and scipy library.
